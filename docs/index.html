<p>Just about any day in which you use an iPhone or iPad for more than a few minutes, you&rsquo;ll almost certainly end up in an app that uses a List View.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the most common way to show a structured, scrollable series of items, and List Views are a core competency for an iOS developer working in SwiftUI, so it&rsquo;s the first complex control we dive into.</p>
<p>Topics in this module include&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparing to Work with Lists</li>
<li>Understanding Lists</li>
<li>Creating a List</li>

<p>The thing that makes an app come alive is the behavior we add, and the dynamic responses to that behavior that get reflected in the user interface.</p>
<p>In any application, a user interface has one critical job: to accurately represent the <strong>data</strong> of our application in what it displays on the screen.</p>
<p>In SwiftUI, data and behavior go hand-in-hand, and I cover how to respond to user interaction in this module.</p>

<p>Users are picky, aren’t they? Everybody has preferences though, so it’s no wonder that you as a developer are often tasked with letting your users to customize their experience within your app.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will learn how to manage user preferences with the <code>UserDefaults</code> system that&rsquo;s built in to iOS</li>
<li>Next, you will explore synchronizing settings with iCloud Key-Value Store</li>
<li>Finally, you will understand how to ship configuration for your app with Property Lists that are included in your application bundle</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4--saving-objects-and-object-graphs" class="anchor-link"><a href="#4--saving-objects-and-object-graphs">4 – Saving Objects and Object Graphs</a></h2>
<p>What if you only wanted to load a subset of the data into memory instead of being locked in to an all-or-nothing situation with <code>UserDefaults</code> or Property Lists?</p>
<p>What if you needed to save a more complex data model that includes relationships?</p>
<p>For that, you’ll need to know about saving and sharing objects and object graphs…</p>
<p><strong>Six Technologies/Frameworks</strong> will be featured in this module:</p>
<ul>
<li>SQLite</li>
<li>Core Data</li>
<li>Realm Database</li>
<li>CloudKit</li>
<li>Realm Platform</li>
<li>Firebase</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to help you answer <strong>two questions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What am I getting myself into if I pick one persistence technology over another?”</li>
<li>“How does it feel to work with this persistence technology in code?”</li>
</ul>
<p>You will answer these questions by…</p>
<ul>
<li>Scanning the arena of persistence options and explore what sets these technologies apart from <code>UserDefaults</code> and Property Lists.</li>
<li>Surveying the setup process to see what it takes to get up and running with each technology in the list</li>
<li>Exploring the data modeling process to wrap your head around what the data structure design process is like for each technology in the list</li>
<li>Getting the feel for working with data so that you understand what it&rsquo;s like to create objects, update them, delete them, query and filter them, and watch for data changes so that you can update your user interface appropriately</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5--saving-data-as-documents-and-files" class="anchor-link"><a href="#5--saving-data-as-documents-and-files">5 – Saving Data as Documents and Files</a></h2>
<p>What if you need to encapsulate chunks of content together and save it all as a packaged up file…as a single unit with a custom file extension?</p>
<p>For that, you need to know about saving data as documents and files.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will explore the use-case for building a &ldquo;document-based application”</li>
<li>Next you will walk through designing a document as a subclass of <code>UIDocument</code></li>
<li>You will learn to create and load documents from a Document Browser</li>
<li>Customizing your app&rsquo;s file extension is a key step that you will work through</li>
<li>You will spend some time understanding how to interact with document data in code as <em>users</em> interact with the user interface</li>
<li>Finally, you will answer the question, “How do I get my app’s files to show up in the iOS Files app?”</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="course-outline" class="anchor-link"><a href="#course-outline">Course Outline</a></h1>
<h2>
  1 – Setting up CloudKit
</h2>
<p>
  Module 1 is the introduction to the course with discussion of the motivating factors for using CloudKit, course prerequisites, storyline overview, and a demo of the end product of the course.
</p>
<p>
  The demo app for this course is a fun one! I put you in the scenario where we team up to build a hazard reporting app for our company’s Safety Department.
</p>
<p>
  The final product will come complete with the ability to save, query, update, and delete text, images, and location information into iCloud using the CloudKit framework.
</p>
<h2>
  2 – Modeling and Saving Data
</h2>
<p>
  Working with CloudKit begins with an understanding of the framework Types that are used to model and save data.
</p>
<p>
  You'll learn about <code>CKRecords</code> and <code>CKAssets</code>, and save your first bits of data up to iCloud in this module.
</p>
<h2>
  3 – Querying, Displaying, Updating, and Deleting Data
</h2>
<p>
  Once data has been saved into an iCloud database, the next logical step is to query it and display it within the app.
</p>
<p>
  I will teach about the <code>CKQuery</code> class for querying the CloudKit database for records and/or assets, so that data can be retrieved and displayed in the UI.
</p>
<p>
  And of course, once data is retrieved and displayed, it's fair game for updating and deleting.
</p>
<h2>
  4 – Synchronizing Data Across Devices
</h2>
<p>
  The whole point of CloudKit is to make sure that data is accessible from more than one device.
</p>
<p>
  One of the primary features still glaringly missing from our Hazard Reporter app at this point in the course is the fact that it doesn’t automatically update when data changes in the CloudKit database.
</p>
<p>
  In this module, I'll teach you about how CloudKit uses subscriptions and push notifications to alert other users’ devices to changes that have occurred in the CloudKit database, so that appropriate action can be taken in code to respond to those changes.
</p>
<p>
  I'll also simulate hazard reports coming in from another user by adding data through the CloudKit Dashboard and watching the screen update with the new data in the iOS app.
</p>
<h2>
  5 – Modeling Relationships Between Record Types
</h2>
<p>
  Modeling relationships between Record Types is important for many scenarios. In this module I will teach how to work with <code>CKReferences</code> in order to represent hierarchical relationships or to represent ownership between model objects.
</p>
<h2>
  6 – Planning for Production
</h2>
<p>
  Apple engineers repeatedly warn that CloudKit error handling isn’t the difference between a good app and a bad app… it’s the difference between a functional app and a non-functional app. To that end, I cover some of the most common CloudKit errors and how to handle them.
</p>
<p>
  And alas, once a version of the app is ready enough to put into users’ hands, it’s crucial to test it and then put it into Production. I will discuss creating an Ad-Hoc deployment of the app so that it can be installed on other users’ devices via iTunes. I will also discuss deploying the CloudKit database schema to Production in preparation for deployment to the App Store.
</p>
<h1>
  Course Resources
</h1>
<p>
  Demos of technology in action are <em>super</em> important to me. That being the case, I tried to pack as much demo content into the course as possible. You'll get to see the full array of dev-time experiences, not just the final "it works perfectly&#8221; outcomes.
</p>
<p>
  The course also comes complete with working Xcode projects that gradually build you up to the final version of the app, one step at a time through each module.
</p>

                <p>Core Data is an extremely powerful framework for managing and persisting data on your users&rsquo; devices. And let&rsquo;s face it: saving data to your users&rsquo; devices is inevitable. The question is, which data management and persistence technology you use when the time comes for <em>you</em> to tackle this challenge?</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://bit.ly/ps-core-data-swift">Core Data Fundamentals with Swift</a>&rdquo; will give you the essential skills you need to architect an app to use Core Data.</p>

<h2 id="1--getting-started-with-core-data" class="anchor-link"><a href="#1--getting-started-with-core-data">1 – Getting Started with Core Data</a></h2>
<p>Module 1 is the introduction to the course with discussion of the motivating factors for using Core Data, course prerequisites, storyline overview, and a demo of the end product of the course.</p>
<p>I had a blast making the demo app. Essentially, I put you in the scenario where we team up to build a prototype of an app that our Human Resources department has come to us with. They came to us with an idea – Over the past year or two, they’ve noticed that employee morale is down a bit. To improve the situation, they’re implementing a new Employee Recognition program. As part of the new program, they’ve come to our internal software development team to see if it might be possible to build some kind of an app that allows employees to recognize one another for jobs well-done – electronic “Shout Outs” if you will.</p>
<p>And that’s where you and I come in – HR wants us to prototype something up so that they have an idea of what’s possible.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, we work on this prototype app together!</p>

<h2 id="2--setting-up-the-core-data-stack" class="anchor-link"><a href="#2--setting-up-the-core-data-stack">2 -Setting up the Core Data Stack</a></h2>
<p>Working with Core Data begins with setting up the Core Data Stack. You will learn how to implement the stack, how to architect your app for testability and maintenance, and how to share Core Data components (such as NSManagedObjectContext) between view controllers.</p>

<h2 id="3--creating-a-data-model" class="anchor-link"><a href="#3--creating-a-data-model">3 – Creating a Data Model</a></h2>
<p>Building a data model is the foundation for persisting information with Core Data. You will learn to create a data model in Xcode, and you will understand how to work with that model in Swift code.</p>

<h2 id="4--building-relationships-between-entities" class="anchor-link"><a href="#4--building-relationships-between-entities">4 – Building Relationships Between Entities</a></h2>
<p>Understanding the importance of relationships and how to build them is vital to the efficiency and expressiveness of your Core Data model. You will learn why building relationships is worth the investment, and then you will gain the skills you need to be able to build these strategic links between Entities in Xcode.</p>

<h2 id="5--saving-accessing-and-deleting-data" class="anchor-link"><a href="#5--saving-accessing-and-deleting-data">5 – Saving, Accessing, and Deleting Data</a></h2>
<p>Having the ability to save data to a Core Data persistent store is essential. Being able to retrieve that data later on for display, for modification, or even for removal from the persistent store is also a critical. You will learn the mechanics of how to use the Core Data framework classes that are involved with saving, accessing, and deleting data in this module.</p>

<h2 id="6--showing-and-synchronizing-data-with-nsfetchedresultscontroller" class="anchor-link"><a href="#6--showing-and-synchronizing-data-with-nsfetchedresultscontroller">6 – Showing and Synchronizing Data with NSFetchedResultsController</a></h2>
<p>Displaying data in a user interface and keeping it synchronized with the state of the persistent store is a critical piece of the Core Data puzzle. You will learn how to use NSFetchedResultsController for keeping table views in sync. You will also examine using the iOS Notification Center as an alternative way to detect and respond to changes in the persistent store.</p>

<h2 id="7--changing-core-data-models" class="anchor-link"><a href="#7--changing-core-data-models">7 – Changing Core Data Models</a></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s inevitable: You&rsquo;re going to have to change your data model from its original form sooner or later. This module will guide you in creating new versions of your data model. You will also learn how to migrate your persistent store to new data model versions so that no data is lost as you make changes.</p>

<h2 id="8--understanding-core-data-changes-in-ios-10-and-macos-sierra" class="anchor-link"><a href="#8--understanding-core-data-changes-in-ios-10-and-macos-sierra">8 – Understanding Core Data Changes in iOS 10 and macOS Sierra</a></h2>
<p>Change is constant. Be prepared for the latest enhancements to the Core Data framework by understanding what&rsquo;s new in Core Data with Apple&rsquo;s latest platforms. You will learn about a new framework class called NSPersistentContainer that is designed to simplify the Core Data stack creation process. This concluding module will also point you to resources that will help you build on your new Core Data foundation.</p>
